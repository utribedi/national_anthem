# Flavors of National Anthems 

(Intro) Why is this study even important?
Have you often wondered why companies and institutions have a motto attached to their brand?
It is to associate their brand or image to to a central idea or virtue. Similarly when it comes to a nation-state, what do you think can be a possible 
indicator of the possible qualities that the founder fathers of a particular country envisioned? Can we loosely say that the national anthem of a country will
have these qualities or virtues mentioned in them in some form or the other? The answer is a big yes!
We often want to understand what qualities are being spoken of in a particular country's national anthem. In this project I have attempted to do someting similar. 

Here I have used a dataset of national anthems of all countries in the world and done text analysis on them initially. Through some of the standard 
text preprocessing techniques I have tried to get the crux of the themes that are being discussed. The hypothesis is that there will be 
many countries that will have similar set of virtues being discussed about in their national anthems. The idea is to group these countries on these 
commaonalities and project them on a world map. Going forward we can extend this research and infer more on these groups of countries.
